How this assignment was done:

I have a 1 hour tutoring session to work through some fundamentals and concept while doing this assignment.

I looked up for some codes on how to solve some issues that I run into while coding. Used GitHub to look for it.

Reverse engineer some of the solutions provided to understand why some of the codes were working and why it wasn't.

YouTube and ChatGPT was helpful to look into how some functions work.

Revisiting the modules again to see what worked and why it was used in such a way.
